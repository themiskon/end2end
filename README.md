The physical and chemical properties of the earth's ocean have changed affecting all life in it and resulting in rapid extiction rates and community shifts. Understanding the processes involved is helpfull in protecting the environmental integrity and in quantitative predictions of environmental services. Numerus mathematical models are set to desctibe marine ecosystems and assess effects of climate change and other anthropogenic activities on them. Although the knowledge on natural sciences and the computational power is increasing, earth is too complex to be simulated by a modern computer. Contemporary solutions involve models limited in space or details. Spatially limited models can provide high resolution in specific ecosystems, whereas generic models describe global trends. In this work the first principles NUM and the fisheries model FEISTY were linked.
